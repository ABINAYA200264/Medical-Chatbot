# 🩺 Medical Chatbot – GenAI Healthcare Assistant  
A Generative AI–powered medical chatbot built using the **Biomistral LLM**, designed to answer general medical and health-related questions safely.  
This project was developed as part of the **GIVI Connected GenAI Program** and implemented entirely in a **Google Colab notebook**.

---

## 🚀 Overview
This chatbot uses the **Biomistral Large Language Model**, a domain-specialized medical LLM, to provide informative and safe responses to user queries.  
The goal of the project is to explore how LLMs can be used in healthcare conversational systems, focusing on:

- Understanding user symptoms/questions  
- Generating medically relevant responses  
- Maintaining safety through controlled prompting  
- Allowing interactive medical Q&A within Colab

## 🧠 Model Used: Biomistral LLM  
This project uses the **Biomistral model**, a medical-domain LLM from the Mistral family, known for:

- High-quality biomedical & clinical knowledge  
- Safety-optimized responses  
- Context-aware reasoning  
- Suitable for medical Q&A use cases  

The chatbot prompts the model to ensure **no diagnosis**, **no prescriptions**, and **no professional medical advice**, maintaining ethical AI usage.

## 📂 Project Structure
Since this is a single-file Colab project, the structure is simple:


The notebook includes:
- Biomistral API integration  
- Prompt engineering for safe medical Q&A  
- Input text processing  
- Chat interface loop  
- Example medical conversations
